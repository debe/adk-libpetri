## 1.2.0 - 2026-06-04

### Java

Replaces Google ADK Java's orchestration core (`SequentialAgent`,
`ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`, `BaseLlmFlow`, `AgentTransfer`, `Runner`)
with a Coloured Time Petri Net runtime on
[libpetri](https://github.com/debe/libpetri), integrated through a
`PetriAgent extends BaseAgent` adapter. **Zero forks** of ADK or genai.

- **Typed boundary catalog** (`AdkColours`) and seven stock subnets:
  `LlmStepSubnet`, `ToolDispatchSubnet`, `PromptBuilderSubnet`,
  `RouterSubnet`, `LlmAgentSubnet` (with the structural reask-budget
  bound), `PersistStateSubnet` (single race-free legacy-session writer),
  and `TransferRouterSubnet` (`Out.xor` over compile-time-known targets;
  hallucinated names become typed error events, not NPEs).
- **ADK integration**: `PetriAgent`, `PetriRunner`, and
  `SessionExecutorRegistry` (two ownership modes: `Cleaner`-bound and
  strong-owned). Stock `InMemoryRunner` consumes a `PetriAgent` with no
  ADK source change.
- **Observability**: `EventStoreToFlowableBridge` and `OtelEventStore`
  (one OpenTelemetry span per transition fire), composed via the
  `EventStore` decorator chain.
- **Verification**: `AdkNetInvariants` ships three structural validators
  on every build, plus SMT property factories proved via libpetri's
  `SmtVerifier`. The two end-to-end demos (`MultiAgentDemoTest`,
  `VoiceSessionDemoTest`) are Z3-proved deadlock-free, with the BIDI
  demo's reachable state space confirmed finite via bounded state-class
  graph exploration.
- **Calling Gemini without `commonPool`**: the `SyncGeminiLlm` exemplar
  calls genai's synchronous API on a virtual thread; voice reads genai's
  Live session directly. ADK's `Gemini`/`GeminiLlmConnection` wrappers
  are bypassed in thin user code rather than forked.
- **Voice/BIDI** subnets (`BargeIn`, `LiveApiRecovery`,
  `LlmStreamingStep`, `Vad`) ship as composable exemplars under
  `src/test/.../demos/voice/`, not as stock library code.

173 tests across 29 test classes, all passing.
